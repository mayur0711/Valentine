description: how to use and test the Magic Link personalization
---

Follow these steps to see the personalize "Magic Link" in action:

1. **Open your project folder** in your file explorer.
2. **Right-click `index.html`** and select **Open with** > **Google Chrome** (or your preferred browser).
3. **Check the address bar**. It will likely look like this:
   `file:///F:/Valentine/index.html`
4. **Add the Magic Parameter** to the end of the URL:
   `?to=Julia`
   (The full URL should look like: `file:///F:/Valentine/index.html?to=Julia`)
5. **Press Enter**.
   - You should see the heading change to: "Will You Be My Valentine, **Julia**? 💕"
6. **Proceed with the flow**.
   - Your name ("Julia") is now saved in the background.
   - When you finish the plan on the activities page, the email sent to you will explicitly mention it's from "Julia".

> [!TIP]
> You can try different names by changing the value after `to=`. Try `?to=Alex` or `?to=Sweetheart`!
